Subject: [JetFighter] bioRxiv manuscript {{ paper_id }}

Dear Authors,

tl;dr. Please consider improving the colormap used on
{{ pages }} of your manuscript entitled

{{ title }}
{{ config['BASE_URL'] }}{{ detail_url }}

before publication.
At least one figure is not accessible to readers with colorblindness
and/or is also not true to the data, i.e. not perceptually uniform.
And, please forgive us if this message has been sent in error.

----


We, scientists, co-opt the human visual system to convey numerical
data in a format that's easily understandable using spatial and color
variation to capture details of the underlying data. A “colormap”
transforms the set of numbers into a pattern of plotted colors. However,
when done poorly, the resulting image is inaccessible to readers with
anomalous color vision (i.e. colorblindness, ~10% of the male population
is red-green colorblind) and includes well-established visual artifacts
that obscure the underlying detail.

The widely-used rainbow colormap, "jet", faces these issues yet is pervasive
in the scientific literature. JetFighter guesses that "jet" or another
rainbow colormap is present on {{ pages }} of your manuscript {{ paper_id }}.
Therefore, we are sending you this email to suggest an improvement
before your manuscript's final publication.

Please consider re-rendering the problematic figures using a
perceptually uniform, colorblind-friendly colormap (resources below).

And, if this message has been sent in error, please accept our apologies.
Do let us know, so we can debug and improve JetFighter!

Best,
Shyam/the JetFighter team
